# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
Difficult week playing catch up. First time using DynamoDB or Postgres locally. I was behind with creating the Notifications webpage on Cruddur but once I watched the video, it connected quickly with no issues.

Most challenging portion of this week was trying to get DynamoDB locally. Plan on practicing on my own to ensure everything works out smoother later in this bootcamp. Did connect to Prostgres without issues using the 'psql -h localhost -U postgres' command since the password did not work for all others that were shown in the video.
